TASK 1:
LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like
square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the
Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.

EXPLANATORY OF THE PROJECT:
 KEY FEATURES:
1.Crime Rate: Per capita crime rate by town.
2.Zoning: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.
3.Industry: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4.Charles River: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
5.NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).
6.Rooms: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
7.Age: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
8.Distance: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
9.Highway: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
10.Tax: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
11.Pupil-Teacher Ratio: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
12.Black: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town.
13.LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population.
14.Median Value: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable).

OBJECTIVES:
 *Predict Housing Prices: Accurately predict the median value of homes in Boston neighborhoods based on the provided features.
 *Understand Feature Importance: Determine which features most significantly influence housing prices.
 *Model Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the linear regression model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
 *Implement and Test Regression Models: Implement linear regression and compare it with other regression techniques if necessary.
 
DESCRIPTION:

The Boston House Price dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for regression analysis and modeling. The dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. It consists of 506 samples and 14 features, describing various aspects of residential areas in Boston.

PROCESS OVERVIEW:

Data Collection: Obtain the Boston Housing dataset, which is available from various sources including the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, standardize/normalize the data, and perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns among the features.

MODEL IMPLEMENTATION:

Linear Regression: Apply linear regression to model the relationship between the features and the target variable (median house value).
Training and Testing: Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.
Interpretation: Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted house prices.
Visualization: Visualize the actual vs. predicted values, residuals, and feature importance to gain insights into the model's performance and behavior.
Benefits of Using Linear Regression:

Simplicity: Linear regression is simple to implement and interpret.
Efficiency: It requires fewer computational resources compared to more complex models.
Baseline Model: Provides a good baseline for comparing with more advanced regression techniques.
Limitations:

Assumption of Linearity: Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable, which may not always hold true.
Sensitivity to Outliers: Linear regression is sensitive to outliers, which can significantly affect the model's performance.
Multicollinearity: High correlation between independent variables can lead to unstable estimates of regression coefficients.
The Boston House Price prediction using linear regression serves as an excellent case study for understanding basic regression techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation in the context of real-world data.
